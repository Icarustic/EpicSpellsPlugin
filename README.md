# EpicSpellsPlugin
EpicSpellsPlugin is a Minecraft Spigot plugin for version 1.18+ that aims to add magic spells to the game for epic pvp and pve fights.

This plugin is still in very early development, which is why there aren't that many spells yet as I'm focused on working on the underlying "framework".

## Features
- cast different spells with unique abilities and visuals
- triggers for different events, such as when hitting a block, entity or player, getting out of a maximum distance and reaching a maximum lifetime
- special pre-made effects, such as realistic explosions
- creativity is pretty much the only limit (apart from technical limitations of Minecraft and the Spigot API of course)

## Installation & usage
- install a Spigot server for 1.18 or higher
- download the EpicSpellsPlugin.jar from the latest release and put it in your server's `plugins` folder
- cast any spell by running `/spell cast <spellname>` and have fun!

## Planned features
- easy spell casting by using a wand and/or items with special abilities
- interaction of spells if two spells hit one another, for example to make a defence spell that blocks other spells
- more pre-made effects to use in spells, such as ice spikes
